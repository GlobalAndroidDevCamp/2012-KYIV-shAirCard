== Enter the shAirCard ==

Ever wondered why exchanging business cards is so tiresome? You either need to have a paper card (outdated, clearly), send digital VCard via Bluetooth (takes up to a minute seconds to share with one person), let the person scan a QR-code of your card  displayed on your phone (still requires a phone in your hand) or tell your Facebook/Google+/LinkedIn account name (requires you and your to-be partner to use the same one).

shAirCard intends to be as simple and seamless as possible. You come to an event, you upload your business card to this event's list and you don't need to take out your phone anymore. Just tell your name and anybody at this event will be able to add your info without your help. No registration, no license agreements, only business.

== Privacy and security ==

Of course, you don't want to share your information with just anybody. There are two levels of personal data protection in shAirCard:

* events with passwords - when one creates an event it is strongly recommended to create a password for it. After that the password is required to view the atendees list and add contacts from it.
* (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) hidden cards - when you upload your card to an event you can mark it as hidden. This way your card won't be shown in the global list, but you'll be given a passphrase. In order to be able to add your card one must know the passphrase and enter it into the application. So you can tell the passphrase only to the limited number of people.

== Technology ==
